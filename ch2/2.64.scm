;; a)
;; as given, 'partial-tree' constructs a balanced binary tree of the first n
;; list elements given. this leads to an easy recursive definition: the problem
;; on list 'e' and len 'n' equals the tree made from left subtree equal to
;; subproblem on 'e' and ~n/2, root of the next smallest unused elem, and
;; right subtree equal to the rest of unused elems and last ~n/2.
;;
;; this produces valid sorted trees due to the in-order list argument and the
;; left->node->right ordering. but why is it balanced? well:
;; - n=0 -> balanced
;; - n=1 -> balanced
;; - n=2 -> balanced
;; - n=3 -> balanced
;; - inductive case for n: a root and 2 balanced subtrees of size ~n/2 produces
;; a balanced tree.
;;
;; pretty cool! amazingly simple. it feels like there should be some more magic,
;; it feels like this is too simple and that it must not work, but...it works!
;; the inductive case is the only way I can prove it to myself.


;; b) each call does constant work and there are Ï´(n) calls since each call
;; selects an element from the list (or none, i.e. leaf subtrees), so the
;; time complexity is O(n).
